#+title: Emacs configuration

This is my emacs configuration.

A few highlights:
+ Modular structure organised with use-package, general and straight for reproducible builds
+ Fast startup (<1s on my system) and clean directory thanks to no-littering
+ Full configuration containing everything you may need with more than 150 packages available

Packages are currently grouped in the following directories:
+ Appearance: fonts, themes and icons
+ Built-in: configuration of packages already available in vanilla emacs
+ Composite: packages working together such as embark, orderless and vertico
+ Utilities: utilities which need to be invoked by the user
+ Passive-utils: utilities working automatically without needing a user input
+ Org: anything related to org-mode
+ Perso: my own experimentations
+ Programming: major modes and utilities for specific programming languages
+ Workflow: packages extending emacs' toolbox
+ Later: packages to audition later
+ Discarded: packages set up but not used in the current configuration
